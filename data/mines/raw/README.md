# Data Source

Data is downloaded first as a CSV from Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD). The URL is https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/geoplatform::mines-and-mineral-resources/about after which the user should click "Download" followed by the "Download" button under the "CSV" option.

If the file gets opened in Excel before being read into statistical software, the date variables will become unusable.
