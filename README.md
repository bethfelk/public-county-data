Source code to produce data on county-level information about a variety of factors.

Final output is placed in `data/county-combined/cleaned/`.

`src/makefile` contains a series of bash commands to build the entire dataset.

Some raw data files exceeded GitHub's 100MB file size limit and are not included; however, the source code should still work to recreate them. Note that the README.md file in each `data/` subdirectory contains details about the data source and how to recreate it.
